Time to fire up the engines!  We have our app, 
lets tell beefy to load it up on port 3000, 
also lets tell beefy to enable live reloading.

Edit the package.json file, by adding a new node:

"scripts": { "start": "beefy app.js 3000 --live }

After running the following command open a 
browser and navigate to http://localhost:3000

To stop the server press [ctrl] + c and then ./n to load the next slide

Cow Says: npm start
